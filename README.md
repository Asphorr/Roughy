# Roughy - A Minimalist Operating System Kernel

## Overview

Roughy is a minimalist, educational operating system kernel written in C and assembly. It aims to provide a basic understanding of operating system concepts and low-level programming.

## Features

- Bootloader support (GRUB compatible)
- Memory management with paging
- Interrupt handling
- Basic console output
- Keyboard input
- Multitasking support
- Simple scheduler
- PCI bus enumeration
- Virtual File System (VFS) interface
- System call interface

## Prerequisites

To build and run MyKernel, you'll need:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS)
- GCC cross-compiler for i686-elf
- NASM assembler
- QEMU for system emulation
- Xorriso (for creating bootable ISO images)

## Building

1. Set up your cross-compiler and ensure it's in your PATH.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/asphorr/roughy.git
   cd mykernel
   ```
3. Build the kernel:
   ```
   make
   ```

## Running

To run Roughy in QEMU:

```
make run
```

## Project Structure
